## 📌 Project Overview

- Built a machine learning system to predict customer churn.
- Implemented data preprocessing, feature engineering, and handled class imbalance.
- Compared multiple algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) with hyperparameter tuning.
- Deployed an API with FastAPI and an interactive Streamlit dashboard with business insights.

- Created new features (e.g., tenure groups, payment categories) to boost model performance
- Model Development
- Trained and compared:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost
- Performed hyperparameter tuning for XGBoost
